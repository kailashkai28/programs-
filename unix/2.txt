They also have a sizable population in Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Nowgong, Hailakandi and Karimganj Districts of the Assam State and also Dimapur and Jiribam region of Nagaland and Manipur state respectively. In Cachar,following the formal conversion of their king Krishna Chandra Hasnusa to Hinduism general Dimasa have largely adopted Hinduism. These new converts to Hinduism are called Barman of Cachar. On the other hand, in Nowgong District the Dimasa have come under the influence of Assamese Vishnavism,and there they are called Hojai Kachari (Hojai is also a name of a Dimasa male clan). This term is also stands for the priest). In Dima Hasao district, a section of the Dimasa called Semsas is confined within the historical village named Semkhor,they eventually developed a distinct dialect.
